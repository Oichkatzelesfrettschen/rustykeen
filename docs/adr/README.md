# ADRs

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are short notes that capture:
- the decision
- the rationale
- the alternatives considered
- consequences and follow-ups

This repo uses ADRs to prevent “doc drift” between `docs/*` and the implementation.

## Naming
- `NNNN-short-title.md` (zero-padded)

## Template
Copy `docs/adr/template.md`.
